# Nonlinear beeswarm plots

Beeswarm plots can be plotted in any combination of `xscale` and `yscale`.  

Specifically, beeswarm plots are correct in any [separable transform](https://geo.makie.org/stable/nonlinear_transforms/#Nonlinear-but-separable) - basically, any transform in which the x and y coordinates are independent of each other.  This excludes most geographic transformations, but includes any transformation you can make using `xscale` and `yscale` in a Makie `Axis`.

```@figure logscale
using SwarmMakie, Makie
data = randn(75) .+ 3
fig = Figure()
ax1 = Axis(fig[1, 1]; title = "No transform")
beeswarm!(ax1, ones(75), data)
ax2 = Axis(fig[1, 2]; title = "Log y axis", yscale = log10)
beeswarm!(ax2, ones(75), data)
fig
```

Note how the shape of the beeswarm is transformed in the left plot, because of the log scale.

```@figure logscale
ax2.xscale = Makie.pseudolog10
ax2.title = "Log x and y axes"
fig
```
