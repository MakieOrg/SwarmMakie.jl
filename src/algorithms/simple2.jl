    SimpleBeeswarm2()

A simple beeswarm implementation, that minimizes overlaps. This is the 
default algorithm used in `beeswarm`.

This algorithm dodges in `x` but preserves the exact `y` coordinate of each point.
If you don't want to preserve the y coordinate, check out [`WilkinsonBeeswarm`](@ref).
